                I am current a fourth-year student at University of Alberta, majoring 
                in Specialization of Computer Science. I am interested in AI and 
                mathetics field. I also participate in CISD club, hopping to help other 
                students who are new to this University or fonding of Science.

            <h3>WorkExperience</h3>
            <p>
                I have lots of working and volunteering experience in different areas. 
                I volunteered in a Salish Shaw Center in Victoria in high school for
                 over a year. And in order to improve my English Speaking, I worked 
                 in a Restaurant in part time locally for over 2 years. Also, during 
                 summer time, me and my friends worked on making apps for clubs. I 
                 have great passion about life and hope to learn more.

            <h4>What can I offer</h4>
            <p>
                My work experience is able to adjust to a new environment fast.
                And I am a hard work, interesting to learn new things.
                I hope my work experience and what I learnt in university can be used 
                during working.
